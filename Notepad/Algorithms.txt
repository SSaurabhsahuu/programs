when calling fun(arr);
int fun(int b[])  or int fun(int *b) 
b is just a pointer , it is pass by reference  

selection sort - the smallest no. is selected and put inthe right place
2) inner iteration is made in unsorted list

insertion sort - next element is selected and  inserted into the sorted list  
2) iteration is made in sorted list

   quick sort(problems)
1. average case O(nlogn) & worst case O(n^2)
2. worst case - whn equal partitns ar nt mde 
3. randomised pivot selection can solve this
4. memory complexity can be decreased by removing tail recursion
5.combination of quick sort & heap srt is usd
