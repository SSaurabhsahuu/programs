Counting Principle					( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvAMa1xQzHQ )
			Number of ways to complete a multipart  task is the product of number of ways to complete individual parts
			solution must not change when we choose different numbers
			
			count all 3 digit numbers	9 * 10 * 10	= 900
						      1-9  0-10  0-10
			count even 3 digit numbers	9 * 10 * 5	= 450
						      1-9  0-10  0,2,4,6,8

			count non repeating 3 digit numbers	right (filling from front)
								9 * 9 * 8 = 648		 			wrong  (filling from back)		 
							      1-9  0-9 0-9		      1-9  0-9  0-9
							except	   7   7,8	    choose      8   1   7	ans     7 * 9 * 10 = 630  
							choose  7  8         	    choose      8   0   7	ans     8 * 9 * 10 = 720
											   both solution are different so wrong
