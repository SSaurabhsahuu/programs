Decisions 	include / exclude	1st/last element of input
		include			1st/last element of solution  & see what are the possibilities ( take min/max of all possibilities ) 
					or ( always include current & may exclude previous subarray contiguous ) 
		take a decision which depends upon previous decision & some state
		sub array is variable & integer is variable  ( 2d dp )
		
framework
	identify subproblem
	take a decision
	check presence of overlapping subproblems
	order of filling
	space optimization
