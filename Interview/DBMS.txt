1. What is Database?
Ans. Database is place where data is stored in an organised way .

2. What is DBMS?
Ans. DBMS is software that is used to create , retrieve ,update and manage the database . 
    It ensures that our data is consistent , organised and easily accessible .
    It is an interface between Database and end User . 

3. What are constraints?
  rules concerning data .
 NOT NULL  , UNIQUE , PRimary  ,Foreign  , default

NOT NULL - restricts null values to insert in column

UNIQUE key - all values in the column should be unique
  	     it allows 1 NULL value
	     a table can have many Unique fields.

PRIMARY KEY is a field or group of Fields that uniquely identifies each row in a Table.
   it should contain Unique and NOT NULL values
   a table can have one and only one primary key.
   it follows entity integrity 

Foreign key is a field in child table that refers to primary key of Parent table.
	There can be Multiple Foreign keys in a table ,each refering to multiple parent table .
	FOREIGN KEY allows inserting NULL values if there is no NOT NULL constraint defined on this key,
	but the PRIMARY KEY does not accept NULLs.(it happens in case of Multiple foreign key) 
	It follows Referential integrity .

	On update Cascade : make changes in child table when parent table is updated

one to many : a customer can have many orders

Many-to-many relation : A customer can buy many products and a product can be buyed by many customers

self Join : it is regular join where table is joined to itself  based on certain columns.
	 eg a table of id, employee_name, manager_id self join to show employee and its manager name
    
Entity is a real world object that has some properties associated with it.

Transaction : is a program unit whose execution may or may not change the contents in a database .
A transaction should have ACID properties
 Atomicity - Either  transaction completes succesfuly or doesnt happens at all
 Consistency - the data should be correct before and after transaction
 Isolation - no other process can change data while trnsaction is running
 Durable   - the data should stored safely after the transaction even after system failure
