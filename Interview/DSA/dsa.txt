What is data-structure?
 A Data Structure is a way of definung , storing and retrieving data in a sytematic manner.

What is asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?
 Asymtotic Analysis refers to mathematical boundation of runtime of an algorithm.
Using asymptotic analysis we can predict the worst , best and average case of an algorithm.

What are asymptotic notations?
Best case is represented by Ω(n) notation.
Worst case is represented by Ο(n) notation.
Average case is represented by Θ(n) notation

What is Greedy approach?
 In a greedy algorithm we take a greedy choice i.e. choosing a locally optimal solution 
that may or may not lead to  globally optimal solution
eg. greedy approach works fine in case of Fractional Knapsack Problem but it gives Wrong result for 0/1 Knapsack Problem

What is Divide and conquer ?
In divide and Conquer algorithm we recursively divide the problem into 2 or more sub problems of same type until
they get easily solved  and then combine results of these sub problems to get the solution of original problem.

What is merge sort ?
Merge sort algorithm is based on Divide and conquer approach as it divides the array in 2 sub halfes untill untill 
only 1 element remains and then merge the sub array in sorted order .
the worst , average and best case time complexity is O(n logn)

what is quick sort?
Quick sort is based on Dac approach as it selects a pivot element and make all elemnts less than pivot to right of it and 
all elments greater than pivot to right of it this divide the array  into 2 parts and then repeat this proceess independently 
in left and right part untill 1 element remains .
the worst case tc is O(n^2) and average case is O(n logn)
    
what is difference between graphs and tree?
A tree is a special type of graph i.e. a tree is a Directed Acyclic Graph where each node has atmost 1 parent where as
in a graph a node can have multiple parents and links can be directed or undirected.
TREE has n nodes and n-1 edges
Graph has V vertices and ATMOST V*(V-1) edges for directed  &  V*(V-1)/2 for undirected

what is dfs?
In dfs we start from the root node and keep on exploring the branch as far as possible and 
backtrack to previous node and repeat this process .
We use STACK to store unvisited Vertex , pop TOS & push_back all its adjacent unvisited nodes & repeat .
It is used to solve maze.
Time complexity O( V + E) for graphs (with Adjacency List)  O(v^2) with adjacency matrix .     https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/depth-first-search/#Complexity-Analysis
A tree  is a graph where edges = V-1    T(n)= O(V+V-1) = O(V)   ( Inorder , Preorder , Postorder ) https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/98968/calculation-of-inorder-traversal-complexity/98998#98998?newreg=613d1ba21da14cfb85bf88de342d5fd2

what is bfs?
in BFS or level order traversal we start from root node and explore all neighbouring nodes at present deph 
and then go to next depth and repeaat this process. 
We use QUEUE to store unvisited Vertex , dequeue it & push_back all its adjacent unvisited nodes & repeat.
Time complexity O( V + E) as we go to each vertex and store all its edges     
 v1 +v2+v3 ...    + (# of v1 edges)+(# of v2 edges)+(# of v3 edges)..... = V + E

Complete graph - every vertex is linked to every other vertex
Connected  - if from every vertex we can reach to every other vertex
 
What is Spanning tree?
A spanning tree is a tree made from given graph having minimum no. of edges and connecting  all vertices.
A complete graph can have maximum n^(n-2) number of spanning trees.
