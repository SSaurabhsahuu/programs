Class	It is a blueprint that contains data members and member functions
Object  It is an instance of a class so it takes data memebers and functions from class 
	and then memory gets allocated to object
 
Features of OOPS
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism

Abstraction    It is a technique by which unnecessary details is hided and only important information is shown to the user
		For eg. we use pow() or sort()  without knowing there implementation details.

Encapsulation  It is a process by which data and function is binded together into a single unit 
		provide security by help of access specifiers.
Inheritance    It is a technique by which a child class is created using another class so that the child class 
		has properties of parent class.
		Inhertance helps in code reusability

Polymorphism   It is a technique by which a function behaves differently under different circumstances

Compile time polymorphism ( Function Overloading  and  Operator overloading) 
	   It is technique by which many functions can have same name 
	   but with different data types and number of arguments and it happens at compile time
Runtime Polymorphism  ( Function Overriding      with help of virtual keyword)
		When a child class has defined same function name as in Parent class
	
Structure Vs Class
	A structure in C is just a group of data and no other class like features like functions,Abstraction,inheritance 
	
	A structure in C++ is similar to Class but default access specifers is public 
	
	A Class has default access specifier as private
