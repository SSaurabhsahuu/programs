             arrays                       linked list
1) pop/insert x :x<n  O(n)  	 | pop/insert befor x  is O(n) with singly but,O(1) for doubly linkedlist
bin searh O(logn) + shifting O(n)|    insert in sort list is O(n) 
				 | insertion in a sorted list is O(n)  as searching is O(n)

2) binary search O(logn)   	 |  linear search O(n) ,Binary Search not possible 
3)  unused space gets wasted  	 |  space is alloted only when needed 
4) no extra space for pointers	 |  extra space for pointers
5) Usage: arrays are used when   |  lists are used when n is not known and we need pop/insert 
   n (no. of elements) is known  |  operation more than search operation
    and we dont want pop/insert  |
   operation but we need to      |
  binary searching               |

Singly link list is used for imlemetation of STACK and QUEUES as we need only Head and Tail elements 
	for enqueu and deque O(1) will take but with arrays it would take O(n)

 Doubly Linked List
. Time Complexity of both singly and doubly is Same
. Implementaion of delete operation is easier in DLL As in SLL we need to keep address of previous node in a new pointer
. Dll is used at many places like
1)  front and back navigation in Files
2)  front and back navigation in websites
3)  undo and redo operation in code editors

Circular link list
 		https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/circular-linked-list/
It donot have any NULL node
It can be made doubly or singly
it is used in implement queue 
and slice time scheduling for process
