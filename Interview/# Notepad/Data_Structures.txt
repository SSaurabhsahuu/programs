stack and queue  elements cannot be accessed
eg.  stack a is given  so  cout<<a[2]   gives error
                 
            arrays < Trees < Linked list
1.Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
2. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
3.Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
