7 layers of OSI model(Open System Interconnection)        5 Layers of TCP/IP Model
 Physical Layer							Physical Layer	
 Data Link Layer						Data Link Layer
 Network Layer							Network Layer
 Transport Layer						Transport Layer

Life Cycle of Packet - When server sends data it passes through all 7 layers (Bottom to up) and 
then at clients end again it passes through 7 layers ( top to bottom) all segments are reassembled again .  

Hub - By it we can send data packets to all computers in a network so it is used for Broadcasting.
	we cannot send packet to only one computer

Switch - By it we can send data frames to particular computer device so it is used for Multicasting

Router - By it we can send Data packets to computer devices in other network.

All computer devices connected to network are called Host 

IP is address of Network 
IP means IP Address has 2 types IPv4(32 bit)( Stable so mostly used ) & IPv6 (64 bit)(not stable so only 20% used)
IP address of a network can be changed but it can be Static(when no need to change IP) Or Dynamic(changes again and again)
IP address can be External IP Address Or Public IP(when ISP using DHCP server assigns IP address to Router i.e the Network)
&  Internal IP Or Private IP (when Router assigns address to all devices in that network)

DNS ( Domin Nmae System )is managed by your ISP (internet service provider)

TCP(Transfer control Protocol) - used for error free transportation of packets     https://www.learnabhi.com/tcp-vs-udp/
it sends data in serial manner & error checking , error recovery is done
It is used to play stored videos, large data , email.
TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection. The connection is full duplex, and both sides synchronize (SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) each other. The exchange of these four flags is performed in three stepsâ€”SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK

UDP(User Datagram Protocol) 
It does not send data serial wise , error checking is done but not recovered(discards error packets )
It is used to stream live videos , small data.
