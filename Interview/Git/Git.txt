Git :  is a Distributed version control system that takes snapshot of whole project insted of storing only differenes
       that other VCS do.
       It basically is mini file system with powerfull tools like Branching, merge,commit etc.

An organization has its project in master repositry of github.( Remote Repositry )
So when a Developer wants to make changes in it he 1st downloads(clone ) it in his computer.(Local Repositry )
( both Remote and local repositry have there own master branch and  new branches )
To do it the Developer runs below commands in his terminal / Command prompt   

1) Make a folder(repository) in your pc where you want project
2) in cmd go to this location 
3) git init           (this initializes a hidden .git folder ) 	 not mandatory
4) git clone https://github.com/SSaurabhsahuu/djangoEcom.git     and paste your local project in local repository created through clone
5) git add file_name			makes changes staged      	    	  	
6) git commit -m  "first Commit"	commit saves changes in local repository   "first Commit" it tells why this commit was done
7) git push				makes changes in Remote repository in github
