Combinators	space   decendent(child + sub child)		div p{  }
		>	child					div > p{  }
		+	next element				div + p{  }
		~	all next elements			div ~ p{  }
Box Model 
 Margin		top  , right, bottom, left ( margin: auto   makes element center but only works when "width" is set)
					  (if width not set use text-align: center)(to remove space betwn divs margin:-2px;)
 Border         style, width, color          border-style property is must without it color and width property donot work
 Padding	top  , right, bottom, left   
 Content	width, height

we cannot change color of margin its transparent 
we can change color of padding by changing background-color

Mor bar pani car

text-align: center	used to align text when width is not set

max screen width 1440px

 width :300px      it makes the element static & no change when window is minimized  ( a horizontal scroll bar comes )
 width : 50%       it makes the element responsive when window is minimized( phones ) and always is 50% of screen
 max-width: 300px  it makes the element responsive when window is minimized under 300px (horzntal scroll bar does not come) 
	      	   and contents are visible in small window without scrolling
     		   do  max-width: 300px   in   https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_dim_max_width

Total width = width + (left  + right padding) + (left + right border) + (left + right margin)
Total height = height + (top + bottom padding) + (top + bottom border) + (top + bottom margin)

* {  box-sizing: border-box;  /* use it so   Total width = width    for all elements           */
  }                             border, padding , margin start filling the width inward direcion and if space is not 
				there it expands out of width

display:block           element starts from new line    ( /n div /n )  eg. div, h1, p, table, list, form
display:inline		element starts from same line   (  <a>  )      eg. a, span, img, input, button
			when block element is changed to display:inline width, height, top & bottom margin are not respcted 	

display:inline_block	element starts from same line keeping height and width property
			when block elemnt is changed to display:inline-block width, height, top & bottom margin are respcted 

background      color, image, repeat, attachment(scroll, fixed), position(right top)
  		background shorthand can be in any order

position        (property   right, left, top, bottom, z-index, clip ) 
static	    Normal position(default position) 
relative    position shifts relative to its static position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
absolute    position shifts relative to ancestor having relative position. Other content occupies gap left by the element. Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
fixed	    position fixed and gap is occupied by other elements
sticky

z-index (when overlaping happens we can set which element is in top)
In case of overflow when an element position exceeds hight or width of parent element and overlaps the parents next element
we use    overflow:auto    and scroll bars come.
 To avoid scroll bar we should manually assign greater height or width


float :left, right              used to make elements eg img to left or right of content
   clear :left, right, both        used in next element, after element having float
			
 If an element is taller than the element containing it,
 and it is floated, it will overflow outside of its container so we use
  .clearfix::after {	 	
	  content: "";
	  clear: both;
 	  display: table;
	}

Flexbox		display: flex;			make child elements into a single row
		flex-wrap:wrap;			wrap the elements into more rows
		flex-direction:row or column	changes  
		justify-content:		changes space between elements in horizonal direction
		align-item:			
		align-content:	 		changes space between elements in vertical direction
